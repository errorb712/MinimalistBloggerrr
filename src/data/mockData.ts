    excerpt: 'Learn how to make restaurant-quality pizza dough at home with this foolproof recipe that delivers crispy, chewy perfection every time.',
    content: `# Perfect Homemade Pizza Dough Recipe

Making pizza dough from scratch might seem intimidating, but with the right technique and ingredients, you can create restaurant-quality pizza at home. This recipe has been perfected over years of testing and will give you that perfect balance of crispy exterior and chewy interior that makes great pizza unforgettable.

## Why Make Your Own Pizza Dough?

Store-bought pizza dough often contains preservatives and lacks the complex flavor that comes from proper fermentation. When you make your own dough, you control every ingredient and can customize the flavor and texture to your preferences. Plus, the process is surprisingly therapeutic and rewarding.

## The Science Behind Great Pizza Dough

Great pizza dough is all about gluten development and fermentation. The gluten provides structure and chewiness, while fermentation develops flavor. The key is finding the right balance of hydration (water content), fermentation time, and handling technique.

## Ingredients You'll Need

- **2 cups (240g) bread flour** - Higher protein content than all-purpose flour for better gluten development
- **1 teaspoon active dry yeast** - For fermentation and rise
- **1 teaspoon salt** - Enhances flavor and strengthens gluten
- **1 tablespoon olive oil** - Adds flavor and helps with texture
- **3/4 cup warm water (110°F)** - Activates the yeast

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Activate the Yeast
In a small bowl, combine warm water and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy. This ensures your yeast is active and will properly leaven the dough.

### Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour and salt. This ensures even distribution of salt throughout the dough.

### Step 3: Combine Wet and Dry
Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour in the activated yeast mixture and olive oil. Using a wooden spoon or your hands, mix until a shaggy dough forms.

### Step 4: Knead the Dough
Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. The dough should be slightly tacky but not sticky. If it's too sticky, add flour one tablespoon at a time.

### Step 5: First Rise
Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat all sides. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours until doubled in size.

### Step 6: Shape and Use
Punch down the dough and turn onto a floured surface. Divide in half for two 12-inch pizzas or keep whole for one large pizza. Roll out to desired thickness and add your favorite toppings.

## Pro Tips for Perfect Pizza Dough

1. **Use a kitchen scale** - Measuring flour by weight is more accurate than volume
2. **Don't rush the rise** - Longer fermentation develops better flavor
3. **Let dough come to room temperature** - Cold dough is harder to stretch
4. **Use semolina flour** - Sprinkle on your pizza stone to prevent sticking
5. **Preheat your oven hot** - 500°F or higher for crispy crust

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Dough too sticky?** Add flour gradually during kneading
**Dough won't stretch?** Let it rest 10-15 minutes to relax the gluten
**Crust too thick?** Roll thinner or stretch by hand for better texture
**Not rising?** Check yeast expiration date and water temperature

## Storage and Make-Ahead Tips

This dough can be made up to 3 days ahead. After the first rise, punch down and refrigerate in an oiled bowl covered with plastic wrap. The cold fermentation actually improves flavor. You can also freeze portions for up to 3 months.

## Conclusion

Making your own pizza dough is a game-changer for home pizza nights. With practice, you'll develop a feel for the dough and can adjust hydration and fermentation time to your preferences. The satisfaction of creating something delicious from simple ingredients never gets old.

    slug: 'react-hooks-complete-guide',
    excerpt: 'Everything you need to know about React Hooks with practical examples and best practices for modern React development.',
    content: `# React Hooks: A Complete Guide

React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components by allowing us to use state and other React features in functional components. This comprehensive guide covers everything from basic hooks to advanced patterns and best practices.

## What Are React Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 and have become the standard way to write React components.

## Why Use Hooks?

- **Simpler code**: No need for class components in most cases
- **Better reusability**: Custom hooks allow sharing stateful logic
- **Easier testing**: Functional components are easier to test
- **Better performance**: Hooks can optimize re-renders more effectively

## Essential React Hooks

### useState Hook

The most commonly used hook for managing component state:

\`\`\`javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
\`\`\`

### useEffect Hook

Handles side effects like API calls, subscriptions, and DOM manipulation:

\`\`\`javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function UserProfile({ userId }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchUser() {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(\`/api/users/\${userId}\`);
        const userData = await response.json();
        setUser(userData);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to fetch user:', error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    }

    fetchUser();
  }, [userId]); // Dependency array

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (!user) return <div>User not found</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <p>{user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
\`\`\`

### useContext Hook

Consumes context values without nesting:

\`\`\`javascript
import React, { useContext, createContext } from 'react';

const ThemeContext = createContext();

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
      <Header />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Header() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  
  return (
    <header className={\`header \${theme}\`}>
      <h1>My App</h1>
    </header>
  );
}
\`\`\`

## Advanced Hooks

### useReducer Hook

For complex state logic:

\`\`\`javascript
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    case 'reset':
      return initialState;
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'reset' })}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}
\`\`\`

### useMemo and useCallback

For performance optimization:

\`\`\`javascript
import React, { useState, useMemo, useCallback } from 'react';

function ExpensiveComponent({ items, onItemClick }) {
  const [filter, setFilter] = useState('');

  // Memoize expensive calculations
  const filteredItems = useMemo(() => {
    return items.filter(item => 
      item.name.toLowerCase().includes(filter.toLowerCase())
    );
  }, [items, filter]);

  // Memoize callback functions
  const handleItemClick = useCallback((item) => {
    onItemClick(item);
  }, [onItemClick]);

  return (
    <div>
      <input 
        value={filter}
        onChange={(e) => setFilter(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Filter items..."
      />
      {filteredItems.map(item => (
        <div key={item.id} onClick={() => handleItemClick(item)}>
          {item.name}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
\`\`\`

## Custom Hooks

Create reusable stateful logic:

\`\`\`javascript
// Custom hook for API calls
function useApi(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchData() {
      try {
        setLoading(true);
        const response = await fetch(url);
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch');
        const result = await response.json();
        setData(result);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err.message);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    }

    fetchData();
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading, error };
}

// Usage
function UserList() {
  const { data: users, loading, error } = useApi('/api/users');

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>;

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map(user => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

1. **Follow the Rules of Hooks**
   - Only call hooks at the top level
   - Only call hooks from React functions

2. **Use the dependency array correctly**
   - Include all values from component scope used inside useEffect
   - Use ESLint plugin for hooks to catch mistakes

3. **Optimize performance wisely**
   - Don't overuse useMemo and useCallback
   - Profile before optimizing

4. **Keep hooks simple**
   - Break complex hooks into smaller ones
   - Use custom hooks for reusable logic

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Missing dependencies in useEffect**
2. **Infinite re-renders from incorrect dependencies**
3. **Overusing useCallback and useMemo**
4. **Not cleaning up subscriptions**

## Conclusion

React Hooks provide a powerful and flexible way to build React components. They simplify state management, improve code reusability, and make components easier to test and understand. Start with the basic hooks and gradually incorporate advanced patterns as your applications grow in complexity.
